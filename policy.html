  <meta name="description" content="Eyeshadow can seem like a tricky part of a makeup look. After all, there are so many different colors, not to mention the brushes. Luckily, even if you’re just starting to use makeup, choosing and applying eyeshadow can be easy. For everyday makeup you can wear to work or lunch with friends, try a natural eyeshadow look. If you want a more dramatic look for a night out, opt for a simple smokey eye that will only take a few minutes to create!">
