  <meta name="description" content="Eyeshadow can seem like a tricky part of a makeup look. After all, there are so many different colors, not to mention the brushes. Luckily, even if youâ€™re just starting to use makeup, choosing and applying eyeshadow can be easy. For everyday makeup you can wear to work or lunch with friends, try a natural eyeshadow look. If you want a more dramatic look for a night out, opt for a simple smokey eye that will only take a few minutes to create!">
